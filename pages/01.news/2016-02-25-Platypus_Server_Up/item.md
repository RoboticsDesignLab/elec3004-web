The [ELEC3004 Platypus server](http://elec3004.uqcloud.net/platypus) is back up.  
The URL is: 
    http://elec3004.uqcloud.net/platypus.
(the shortcuts http://platypus.elec3004.org and  http://platypus.elec3004.com will also work).

Please try to login to the page (it should say Platypus: ELEC3004 at the top).  You will see a practise problem set, which is for Platypus useage practise.

Sorry for the delay with the login, there was an power failure this weekend that seems to have caused some bugs.  

Problem set 1 will be released soon.

Regards,

Surya
