##Welcome to Systems: Signals and Controls.

This course covers the fundamental theory and practice of linear system analysis.  The course deals with systems in their general sense, their inputs, their outputs, and the mathematical models that describe their behaviour.  It generalizes the continuous-time circuits (and systems) seen in ELEC 2004 and introduces discrete-time representations.  It is more than just a "discrete-time" version of ELEC 2004.  The discussion of these topics is motivated by the domains of signal processing and linear feedback control.

Some of the topics touched by the class include: Linear algebra, a mathematical perspective on signals (singularity functions, complex exponentials and geometrics), system properties (linearity, time-invariance, memory, causality, stability), Fourier representations, Laplace and Z transforms, sampling & reconstruction, A/D and D/A converters, DFT/FFT, stochastic processes, filters, representations of linear, time-invariant systems (difference and differential equations, block diagrams, system functions, poles and zeros, convolution, impulse and step responses, frequency responses). the effects of feedback, and an introduction to discrete digital control.  Applications are drawn broadly from engineering, including feedback and control, signal processing and computer science (e.g. computer vision, computer graphics and robotics).

This class is special.  It is about seeing a system and a signal for what it is -- information in motion.
